# üèÅ Getting Started 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), so you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) first, in order to test the project.

```
git clone https://github.com/luanalessa/githubexplorer-alphaedtech.git
```

So, in the project directory, you can run:

```
yarn start
```

Finally, open [localhost](http://localhost:3000) to view the project in your the browser.
